# Temperary Disable SmartTab and Other Unneccessary Effects When Pasting Text to Vim

I enable `smarttab` in my `vimrc`, which is very useful when coding. However, it may ruined your indent when pasting text from other window.

There's a `paste mode` in vim. In this mode, these styling and formatting won't
effect texts. Enter the mode by command `:set paste` and `:set nopaste`.

Also, you can add this line to bind a shortcut key.
```sh
set pastetoggle=<F3>
```
