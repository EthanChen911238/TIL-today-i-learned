# Check wifi connection and guide users to set it.

## Overview

Sometimes, we want our app works when wifi connected, but we don't want to bother users go to Settings and try to find wifi setting themselves because that will make them leave our app and break the flow we designed for them.

Since users have been directed to wifi Setting, how can we get them back to our app? That's our topic today.


## Goals

1. Detect wifi connection
2. Send users to Wifi Setting
3. Back to app after wifi is connected
