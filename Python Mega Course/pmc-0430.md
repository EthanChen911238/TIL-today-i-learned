# Study Note - Python Mega Course 04/30

## Notes:

### User Input
- user function `input()` to get user input in terminal.

```python
usr_input = input("Something to show on screen")
```


### zip()
- `zip() ` return a iterator of tuple which the i-th tuple contains the i-th element of each list
- __NOTE__: `zip()` returns a  `zip` Object not a list


```python

>>> X = ["x1", "x2", "x3"]
>>> Y = ["y1","y2", "y3"]
>>>
>>> M = ["m1", "m2"]
>>> N = ["n1", "N2", "N3", "N4"]
>>>
>>>
>>> Z = zip(X, Y, M, N)
>>>
>>> list(Z)
[('x1', 'y1', 'm1', 'n1'), ('x2', 'y2', 'm2', 'N2')]

```


### File handling

__Open file__:  
    - open file `file = open('file.ext', 'r')`
    - `r` stands for read, can be replace with `w` for writing, `a` for appending or `r+`, `w+`, `a+` for both reading and writing.
    - `r+`, `w+`,`r`, and `w` will open the file with the pointer in the begining of the file, while `a` and `a+` will open the file with the pointer in the end of the file.

__Reading file__:
    - `contents = file.read()` will dump all the contents into variable `content`.
    - `lines = file.readlines()` will returns a list of line from the file.
    - **NOTE**: the pointer will move while reading file. 
    - Use `file.seek(0)` to move pointer back to the begining of the file.


__Writing file__:
    - `file.write("some content")` will wirte a new line in the file.
    - Make sure to run `file.close()` after the writing process is done. The `close()` function will  save and close the file.

__With__
    - The keyword `with` basically open the file temporary  and close the file automatically after with block ends

```python
with open('example.txt', 'a+') as file:
    file.seek(0)
    contents = file.read()
    file.write("something new")
```
